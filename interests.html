						<h1>
						Computers
						</h1>
							<p>
							Computers have been an interest of mine ever since I discovered minesweeper when I was 5.
							As I grew older, this interest turned into building my own computer in grade 9 and learning
							to program in python, c#, and visual basic.

						Model United Nations
						</h1>
							<p>
							Model United Nations is a Canada-wide conference that is held every few months for high school
							and university students to meet and discuss current world problems. I have been to 5 of 
							these conferences, and through that experience, I learned invaluable teamwork and leadership 
							skills by learning how to compromise with others in international diplomacy.

						<h1>
						Chess
						</h1>
							<p>
							Chess is my favourite board game. I hosted my high school's chess club. My club would 
							meet weekly to simply play chess with each other for fun. I also held tutorials where 
							club members could come to learn strategies in chess. As a club, we also attended 
							local tournaments with other schools.

						<h1>
						Tennis
						</h1>
							<p>
							I have been playing tennis since grade 7 and it is by far my favourite sport. In high school,
							playing tennis with my friends at my high school's tennis court was one of my most enjoyable
							pastimes.
