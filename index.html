				hi! welcome to my website.
			</p>

			<p id='paragraphs'>
				my name is jeffrey and i am a first year computer engineering student at the university of waterloo. 
				you can learn more about my program 
				<a href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/" style="color:blue">
				here</a>.
			</p>

			<p id='paragraphs'>
				choosing computer engineering as my major was the most pragmatic decision. my two 
				interests are programming and building different things. my interest for building 
				started when my parents bought me my first lego set, and my passion for programming 
				began when i built my first "hello world" program in visual basic during my grade 9 year. 
				from there, i branched out into other programming and design languages such as python, 
				c#, html, and css. these two interests combined with my eagerness to learn led me to 
				develop many projects in fields such as web design, object-orientated programming, 
				robotics, and energy efficiency engineering.
